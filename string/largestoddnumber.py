# Largest Odd Number in a String

# Given a string s, representing a large integer, the task is to return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a substring of the given string s.

# The number returned should not have leading zero's. But the given input string may have leading zero. (If no odd number is found, then return empty string.)
# Examples:
# Input : s = "5347"
# Output : "5347"
# Explanation :
# The odd numbers formed by given strings are --> 5, 3, 53, 347, 5347.
# So the largest among all the possible odd numbers for given string is 5347.
# Input : s = "0214638"
# Output : "21463"
# Explanation :
# The different odd numbers that can be formed by the given string are --> 1, 3, 21, 63, 463, 1463, 21463.
# We cannot include 021463 as the number contains leading zero.
# So largest odd number in given string is 21463.
