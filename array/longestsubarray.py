# Longest subarray with sum K

# Given an array nums of size n and an integer k, find the length of the longest sub-array that sums to k. If no such sub-array exists, return 0.
# Examples:
# Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 7, 1, 9],  k=15
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# The longest sub-array with a sum equal to 15 is [5, 2, 7, 1], which has a length of 4. This sub-array starts at index 1 and ends at index 4, and the sum of its elements (5 + 2 + 7 + 1) equals 15. Therefore, the length of this sub-array is 4.
# Input: nums = [-3, 2, 1], k=6
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# There is no sub-array in the array that sums to 6. Therefore, the output is 0.
