# Second Largest Element

# Given an array of integers nums, return the second-largest element in the array. If the second-largest element does not exist, return -1.
# Examples:
# Input: nums = [8, 8, 7, 6, 5]
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# The largest value in nums is 8, the second largest is 7
# Input: nums = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# Output: -1
# Explanation:
# The only value in nums is 10, so there is no second largest value, thus -1 is returned
