# Minimum days to make M bouquets

# Given n roses and an array nums where nums[i] denotes that the 'ith' rose will bloom on the nums[i]th day, only adjacent bloomed roses can be picked to make a bouquet. Exactly k adjacent bloomed roses are required to make a single bouquet. Find the minimum number of days required to make at least m bouquets, each containing k roses. Return -1 if it is not possible.
# Examples:
# Input: n = 8, nums = [7, 7, 7, 7, 13, 11, 12, 7], m = 2, k = 3
# Output: 12
# Explanation: On the 12th the first 4 flowers and the last 3 flowers would have already bloomed. So, we can easily make 2 bouquets, one with the first 3 and another with the last 3 flowers.
# Input: n = 5, nums = [1, 10, 3, 10, 2], m = 3, k = 2
# Output: -1
# Explanation: If we want to make 3 bouquets of 2 flowers each, we need at least 6 flowers. But we are given only 5 flowers, so, we cannot make the bouquets.
