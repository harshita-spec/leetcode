# Median of 2 sorted arrays

# Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

# The median is defined as the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. In case the length of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
# Examples:
# Input: arr1 = [2, 4, 6], arr2 = [1, 3, 5]
# Output: 3.5
# Explanation: The array after merging arr1 and arr2 will be [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]. As the length of the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. Here two medians are 3 and 4. So the median will be the average of 3 and 4, which is 3.5.
# Input: arr1 = [2, 4, 6], arr2 = [1, 3]
# Output: 3.0
# Explanation: The array after merging arr1 and arr2 will be [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 ]. The median is simply 3.
