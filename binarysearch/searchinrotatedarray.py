# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

# There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

# Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be left rotated by 3 indices and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

# Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: 4
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: -1
# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [1], target = 0
# Output: -1
