# Find out how many times the array is rotated

# Given an integer array nums of size n, sorted in ascending order with distinct values. The array has been right rotated an unknown number of times, between 0 and n-1 (including). Determine the number of rotations performed on the array.
# Examples:
# Input : nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The original array should be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 4 times.
# Input: nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The original array should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 3 times.
