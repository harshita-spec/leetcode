# Find peak element

# Given an array arr of integers. A peak element is defined as an element greater than both of its neighbors.
# Formally, if arr[i] is the peak element, arr[i - 1] < arr[i] and arr[i + 1] < arr[i].

# Find the index(0-based) of a peak element in the array. If there are multiple peak numbers, return the index of any peak number.

# Note:
# As there can be many peak values, 1 is given as output if the returned index is a peak number, otherwise 0.
# Examples:
# Input : arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 1]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: In this example, there is only 1 peak that is at index 7.
# Input : arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: In this example, there are 2 peak numbers at indices 1 and 5. We can consider any of them.
